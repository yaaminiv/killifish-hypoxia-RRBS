Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.6
Cutadapt version: 3.5
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 12862). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 0)
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; auto-detected)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
File was specified to be an MspI-digested RRBS sample. Read 1 sequences with adapter contamination will be trimmed a further 2 bp from their 3' end, and Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 2 bp from their 5' end to remove potential methylation-biased bases from the end-repair reaction
File was specified to be a non-directional MspI-digested RRBS sample. Sequences starting with either 'CAA' or 'CGA' will have the first 2 bp trimmed off to remove potential methylation-biased bases from the end-repair reaction
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Running FastQC with the following extra arguments: --outdir /vortexfs1/scratch/yaamini.venkataraman/02-trimgalore --threads 28
Output file will be GZIP compressed
